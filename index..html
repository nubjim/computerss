			<h2 id="whypart">Why do you need do know about the parts</h2>
			<p id="whypartexp">It is very important to know what is inside a computer if you don't want to get upgrades or repairs/replacements done by a professional.
			It is also a good idea to look what components are in the computer if you buy a prebuilt computer if you plan to use it for anything other than school or work. 
			Making videos, playing video games, or even 3d modeling take more computer power than writing essays. In this page I will talk about the different parts in a computer 
			that are necessary when building or even buying a computer. Lets get started!</p>
			<hr>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			
			<h3 class="parthead">The case</h3>
			<p>Lets start off with the case. A computer case is not only a cosmetic plus but it also is very important with
			   cable management and making sure the parts inside are safe. Let's go through some "<strong><em>Do's</em></strong>" when purchasing a case
			   for your computer </p>
				<h4 class="point">-Make sure the motherboard is compatible</h4>
			   		<p class="pointexp">One of the worst things about building a computer is, finding out your motherboard is incompatible with your case</p>
			    <h4 class="point">-Make sure there is room for your powersupply</h4>
			    	<p class="pointexp">Another horrible thing is finding out your powersupply is to big, make sure you do some research and find out if your
			    	powersupply is the right size</p>
				<h4 class="point">-Make sure your hard drive fits</h4>
					<p class="pointexp">This one is pretty self explanatory considering the last point</p>
				<h4 class="point">-Make sure there are either; Room for fans or fans built in</h4>
					<p class="pointexp">This is very important because the components within a computer get very hot</h4>
			<hr>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			
			<h3 class="parthead">The Power Supply</h3>
			<p>The next part is the <strong>power supply</strong>. The power supply is very important because, well it supplies power to everything in the computer.
			this part is pretty self explanatory so I wont spend any more time explaining this. Let's get right into things to look out for when purchasing a power supply.</p>
				<h4 class="point">-Make sure the power supply has enough power output to run everything</h4>
					<p class="pointexp">What I mean by this is; everything needs a certain amount of power when being used. If you are planning on buying and using super nice 
					top end models look into a more powerful power supply to make sure you get the power output you need</p>
				<h4 class="point">-Make sure your power supply is compatible with your motherboard</h4>
					<p class="pointexp">Most power supplies are compatible with most motherboards but, if you have a very old powersupply and a very new mother board things wont
					work out very well.</p>
			   	<h4 class="point">-If buying a super powerful power supply make sure it will fit in your case</h4>
			   		<p class="pointexp">Super powerful power supplies are generally bigger than less powerfull ones. If you buy a super powerful power supply
			   		make sure to check the measurements which should be in the about section of the product</p>
			<hr>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			
			<h3 class="parthead">Mother Board</h3>
			<p>This part is probably one of the most <em><strong>important</strong></em>parts in the entire computer, right after the cpu but we will get into that later.
			The motherboard is pretty much the nervous system of a computer <em>NOT THE BRAIN</em> more on that later. What the mother board does is, coordinates everything going on within the computer.
			The motherboard makes sure everthing is running correctly and when it needs to be ran. That being said, lets get into the things you need to take into consideration when buying a mother board</p>
				<h4 class="point">-Buy the motherboard first!</h4>
					<p class="pointexp">I'm not sure if I can stress this enough! It is very import to buy the motherboard first if you aren't experienced with compatible parts. Different motherboards are compatible
					with different parts. Some take graphic cards that others don't, and some take processors that other don't.</p>
				<h4 class="point">-Check the measurement to make sure it will fit in the case</h4>
					<p class="pointexp">This is pretty important because the motherboard, more often than not, cannot be fitted into the case if it doesn't have pre cut corresponding mounting point. This leads to 
					another point that I will explain later.</p>
				<h4 class="point">-Make sure the motherboard either comes with or you separately purchase risers</h4>
					<p class="pointexp">This is very import because if you don't, your mother board will short and break it. <em><strong>DONT FORGET THIS</em></strong></p>

			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			
			<h3 class="parthead">CPU - Central Processing Unit</h3>
			<p>This part here is by far the most <em>IMPORTANT</em>, <em>NECASSARY</em> part in the ENTIRE computer. Now these devices may be super small but, dont let that deceive you!
			These tiny chips are the "<em>Brains</em>" of the computer. It is mind blowing what a CPU chip can do. And it is necassary to the build. With these
			I would recommend spending the most on because, the better the CPU the better the processing power. Do keep in mind, however, you will need more money when buying a GPU</p>
